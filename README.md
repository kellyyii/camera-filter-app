Here's an edited version of a README for a Python-based filter app using OpenCV:

---

# Filter App

This application allows users to apply various filters to images using OpenCV, a powerful library for image processing in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python** (version 3.6 or higher)
2. **OpenCV** (for image processing)

To install the required libraries, follow the steps below.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Python

First, download and install Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can choose the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.11 or 3.10).

### Step 2: Open Terminal

You can use any terminal or command-line interface. Options include:

- Command Prompt (cmd)
- Python Shell
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal

### Step 3: Install OpenCV

In the terminal, run the following command to install OpenCV:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filter-app.git
cd filter-app
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Upload an image through the app interface.
2. Choose from various filters available (e.g., grayscale, blur, edge detection).
3. Preview and save the filtered image.
